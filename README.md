electric_field_pong
===================

A well known and loved game of pong with a little twist

DESCRIPTION: 
    This is exactly like pong except some of the blocks 
    emit electric fields directed radially away from the source, 
    and the ball is a charged particle. When the particle enters 
    the effective radius of an electric field it will feel a force. 
    This force will change the velocity of the particle, thus 
    deflecting the particle from its otherwise straight trajectory.

CONTROLS: 
   - mouse click to start
   - press the 'a' key on your keybord to accelate the ball
     (you may want to do this when the particle is moving annoyingly slow)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: This App should work on any Mac
